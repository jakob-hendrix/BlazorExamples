Cases I want to explore with Blazor

- WASM app that uses data in a text document included with the payload (json, etc) to seed data for the user
- WASM app with a login against my own IdentityServer
- WASM app with a login against AzureAD
- WASM/Server app with a login where the user can save data to a data store
- Desktop app (MAUI)
- WASM and API deployed from the same solution
